# python-web-scraper

First you need to install the following dependancies: 

    pip install beautifulsoup4
    (or simply:
    pip install bs4)
    pip install requests

simple web scraper

the main.py file uses "https://webscraper.io" as the designated site.
this site is designed to be scraped!! =)

the instaScraper.py takes an instagram username 
and gets user's followers and following and posts number and the account's name

thank you ;)
